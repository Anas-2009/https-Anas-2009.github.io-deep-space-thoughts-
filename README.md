            <h2>ANMU Explosion Theory</h2>
            <p><strong>Developed by Anas, the ANMU Explosion Theory offers a unique perspective on the universe’s creation.</strong> According to Anas, before the Big Bang Theory, there existed a primordial event, which he calls the “Circle Light Explosion” (CL Explosion), a significant part of the ANMU Explosion Theory.</p>

            <h3>The Circle of Creation and CL Explosion</h3>
            <p>In Anas's theory, the beginning of everything lies in a singular, closed circle. Within this circle was light, emanating from a godly, supreme source beyond comprehension. This light was trapped inside the circle by the phenomenon of total internal reflection, meaning the light could not escape but continually bounced within. This light, the fundamental element of creation, continued to enter the circle from the supreme source, causing energy and frequency to build up exponentially.</p>

            <p>This growing accumulation of light waves led to increasing energy and pressure, ultimately reaching a critical point where the circle could no longer contain it. The massive energy buildup resulted in a series of explosions—the Circle Light Explosion (CL Explosion)—which expanded the circle and allowed the light to spread out. The CL Explosion marked the birth of dense gases and matter within the primordial circle, laying the foundation for what would later become the universe as we know it.</p>

            <h3>The Big Bang as a Subsequent Explosion</h3>
            <p>After the Circle Light Explosion, the gases and matter formed by the expanding light continued to condense and cool, creating regions of dense material. Then, a final explosion occurred, resembling what modern science refers to as the Big Bang. This event scattered the dense gases and particles outward, expanding the universe further and giving rise to stars, galaxies, and other cosmic structures. Thus, according to the ANMU Explosion Theory, the Big Bang was a secondary event, triggered by the initial CL Explosion that set the cosmic framework in motion.</p>

            <h3>The ANMU Formula</h3>
            <p>Anas proposes a unique formula to quantify the energy dynamics within the confined light circle:</p>
            <p><strong>E = L &times; f &times; R<sup>2</sup></strong></p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>E</strong> is the total energy buildup within the circle.</li>
                <li><strong>L</strong> represents the intensity of light entering from the godly source.</li>
                <li><strong>f</strong> is the frequency generated by the reflection and confinement of light waves.</li>
                <li><strong>R<sup>2</sup></strong> accounts for the circular boundary’s area, determining the confinement’s spatial limitations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As the radius of the circle (R) expanded due to the CL Explosion, the energy (E) transformed into matter and gases, leading to the conditions that would spark the Big Bang and result in the creation of the universe.</p>
